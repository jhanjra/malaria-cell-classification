# Malaria-Cell-Classification
Classification of red blood cell microscope slides for malaria using Python

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook which uses various data processing and machine learning methods to analyze a dataset from the NIH's National Library of Medicine containing images of malaria infected and healthy red blood cells. The dataset contains a total of 27,556 images, half spread among each class. The notebook compares a few common machine learning algorithms for classification and provides their performance.
